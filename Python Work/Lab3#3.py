#Pseudo Code:
# 1)calculate how many cups of sugar go in for 1 cookie
# 4)calculate how many cups of sugar go in for 518 cookies
# 5)calculate how many cups of butter go in or 518 cookies
# 6)calculate how many cups of flour go into 518 cookies
# 7)print each calculation of how much of the ingredients go into 518 cookies

sugar = round(1.5 / 48, 2)
butter = round(1 / 48, 2)
flour = round(2.75 / 48, 2)
total_sugar = sugar * 518
total_butter = butter * 518
total_flour = flour * 518
print("You will need", total_sugar, "cups of sugar,", total_butter, "cups of butter,", "and", total_flour, "cups of flour for 518 cookies.")
